# TimeLogix

TimeLogix is a simple, intuitive Tkinter-based time tracking application designed to help contractors log and manage their working hours effectively. This tool was created so I could keep proper track of time worked under a contract for a company, ensuring accurate record-keeping and easy export of session data for billing and reporting purposes.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Tracking:** Easily log your work sessions with start and stop buttons.
- **Session Logging:** View session start times, end times, and durations both in \(H:MM:SS\) and decimal hours.
- **CSV Export:** Export your session data to a CSV file for further processing or billing.
- **Simple UI:** A clean and minimal user interface built using Tkinter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timelogix.git
   cd timelogix
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   There are no additional dependencies beyond the Python Standard Library. However, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.

```bash
python time_logix.py

### How to Use

   - Click the **Start Tracking** button to log the starting time of your work session.
2. **Stop Tracking:**
   - Click the **Stop Tracking** button to end the session. The app will display and log the duration in both formats, e.g., `1:30:00` and `1.50 hours`.
3. **Export Sessions:**
   - Once youâ€™re finished working, click the **Export Sessions** button to save your session data into `working_sessions.csv`.

## Customizations

- **Decimal Hours:** The app calculates hours worked in decimal format using a helper function.
- **CSV File Export:** Sessions are exported to a CSV file with headers: `Start Time`, `End Time`, `Duration (H:MM:SS)`, and `Decimal Hours`.
